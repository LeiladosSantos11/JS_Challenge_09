# JS_Challenge_09:

loops and arrays part 1:

Challenge: you are at your shift at the shop and the owner 
has left you with a long list of things in the inventory. 
He has asked you to find out how many 'mustard' and 'Mustard' bottles you have in 
stock. Use a for loop to count the amount of 'mustard' you have.
